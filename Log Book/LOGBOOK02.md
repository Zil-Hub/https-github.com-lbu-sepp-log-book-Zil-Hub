### Most Used Programming Languages 

- #### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for adding dynamic elements on websites. It enables dynamic content like animations, form validation, and interactive maps. As a client-side language, it runs in the user's browser, allowing websites to respond to user actions without needing to reload the page.

JavaScript manipulates HTML and CSS to change the structure, style, and content of web pages in real-time. It handles user events, such as clicks and keypresses, triggering corresponding responses. It also manages and processes data, often communicating with servers through AJAX or APIs. Additionally, JavaScript powers interactive elements like slideshows, pop-ups, and real-time updates, enhancing the user experience on web applications.
- #### Python 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to create software, websites, and analyze data. It is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for many different purposes. 
Python is used in web development to build websites. It can be used for data analysis, Python is used to analyze data. Automation, Python can automate tasks. Python is often used for AI because of its simple syntax. Python can be used for SEO as well as blockchain and game development.
Python is an object-oriented language, but also supports procedural and functional programming.
- #### Java

Java is a programming language that is used to create applications for mobile devices, the web, and enterprise software. It is a multi-platform language, which means that programs written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is primarily used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and web applications. It supports multithreading, allowing efficient execution of multiple tasks simultaneously. 
Javaâ€™s rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Spring and Hibernate, makes it a popular choice for developing robust, maintainable applications across various industries.
It is an object-oriented language based on the syntax rules of C and C++.
- #### C++

C++ is a programming language used to create software. It's an object-oriented language that gives programmers more control over how their programs use memory and system resources. C++ is often used to create large-scale applications, such as operating systems, search engines, and video games.C++ is used to write programs for microprocessors in devices like medical machinery, smart devices, and home appliances.C++ is used to create virtual and augmented reality applications, such as Unreal Engine.
C++ is used to create technology infrastructure for banks and financiers, which drives financial modeling, trading, and finance applications. C++ is used to create communications infrastructure, such as broadband and telephones. 
C++ is used to create graphics and special effects for movies.
- #### PHP

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, and it's a scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. It's a server-side language, which means that the server executes the PHP instructions before sending the page to the browser. With its ability to connect to databases like MySQL, PHP is often used to create content management systems (CMS) and e-commerce platforms. It supports various frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, which streamline the development of robust applications. PHP is also known for its ease of integration with HTML, making it a valuable tool for creating dynamic web pages, email handling, and server-side processing tasks.

### Key Figures in Programming Languages

- #### Guido Van Rossum

Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language. He grew up in the Netherlands and studied at the University of Amsterdam, where he graduated with a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. His first job after college was as a programmer at CWI, where he worked on the ABC language, the Amoeba distributed operating system, and a variety of multimedia projects. During this time he created Python as side project. He then moved to the United States to take a job at a non-profit research lab in Virginia, married a Texan, worked for several other startups, and moved to California. In 2005 he joined Google, where he obtained the rank of Senior Staff Engineer, and in 2013 he started working for Dropbox as a Principal Engineer. In October 2019 he retired.

- #### Bjarne Stroustrup

Bjarne Stroustrup is a Danish computer scientist best known for designing and developing the C++ programming language. He began working on C++ in the early 1980s to enhance the C language with object-oriented features, making it a widely used language for system/software development, gaming, and performance-critical applications. It originated from analysis of the UNIX kernel to investigate to what extent it can be distributed over a network.

- ##### Brian Kernighan

Brian Kernighan recognized for groundbreaking work on computer programming languages. The Research & Development Council of New Jersey has awarded Brian Kernighan the Science & Technology Medal, the Council's highest honor, for his groundbreaking work on computer programming languages. He co-authored the influential book The C Programming Language with Dennis Ritchie, which helped popularize the C language. Kernighan also contributed to the development of UNIX and authored several other key works in computing.

- #### Dennis Ritchie

He created the C programming language and the Unix operating system and B language with long-time colleague Ken Thompson. His work on C greatly influenced modern programming languages, and UNIX became a foundational system for many modern operating systems. Ritchie's contributions have had a lasting impact on computer science and software development. He co-authored the influential book The C Programming Language with Brian Kernighan, which helped popularize the C language.

- #### James Gosling

James Arthur Gosling OC (born 19 May 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language. Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to window systems. Gosling encountered a problem when he needed to write a program to translate software code from one language to another. Seeing the inherent problem with this, Gosling set out to create a programming language that could be written once and run anywhere (with the help of a few others, such as Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton). Thus, Java (and the JVM) was born!
