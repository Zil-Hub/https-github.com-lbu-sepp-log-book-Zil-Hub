#### Margaret Hamilton

Margaret Hamilton was computer scientist who led the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. In 1961 she was contracted with NASA to develop the Apollo program's guidance system. She was one of the first computer software programmers. Hamilton was responsible for the software that allowed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to land on the Moon. She is also credited with inventing the term software engineering.


#### Donald Knuth

Donald Knuth is an American mathematician and computer scientist most famous for his contributions to the study of algorithms and inventing the TeX typesetting language. He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming and has been called the "father" of the analysis of algorithms. He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science.

#### David Parnas

David Parnas is a Canadian early pioneer of software engineering, who developed the concept of information hiding in modular programming, which is an important element of object-oriented programming today. He is also noted for his advocacy of precise documentation. His revolutionary concepts, encapsulated in the renowned “Parnas Papers,” transformed how we approach software development, turning chaotic code into elegant, manageable systems.

#### Richard Stallman

Richard Stallman launched the Free Software Movement in 1983 by announcing the plan to develop the GNU operating system, intended to be composed entirely of free (freedom-respecting) software. He also invented the concept of copyleft to protect the ideals of this movement, and enshrined this concept in the widely-used GPL (General Public License) for software.

#### Linus Torvalds

Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and lead developer of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed version control system Git. 1991: The Linux kernel is publicly announced on 25 August by the 21-year-old Finnish student Linus Benedict Torvalds. Version 0.01 is released publicly on 17 September. 1992: The Linux kernel is relicensed under the GNU GPL. The first Linux distributions are created.

#### "Uncle Bob" Martin

Robert Cecil Martin, colloquially called "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer,instructor, and author. He is most recognized for promoting many software design principles and for being an author and signatory of the influential Agile Manifesto.
